## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is designed to provide expertise in building scalable applications using Python. The app mimics a Telegram-like messaging platform, using Redis and PostgreSQL to manage messages and users. It uses FastAP AND gRPC for the API backend and is designed to help developers learn how to set up web applications with proper database configuration and handling.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name="getting_started"></a>

These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project that will be run on your local machine for development and testing. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on whether

### Prerequisites

To run the project, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.10+ 
- Redis
- PostgreSQL

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Frengocode/Telegram-App.git

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   For Windows .\venv\Scripts\activate
   For Liniux/MacOS source venv/bin/activate

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv

5. Configure the application by editing the core/config.py file. Make sure to provide the correct values for PostgreSQL and Redis connections.

6. Create the necessary databases for the services. Database files are located in the database/ folder.

7. üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
You can run the unit tests to verify that everything is working correctly. The tests ensure that the application functions as expected.
Example of running tests:
    ```bash
      python -m pytest tests/
