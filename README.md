## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is designed to provide experience in building scalable applications with Python. The application simulates a Telegram-like messaging platform using Redis and PostgreSQL for managing messages and users. It uses FastAPI for the backend API and aims to help developers learn how to set up web applications with proper configuration and database handling.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run the project, you need to have the following installed:
- Python 3.10+ 
- Redis
- PostgreSQL

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Frengocode/Telegram-App.git

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   For Windows .\venv\Scripts\activate
   For Liniux/MacOS source venv/bin/activate

4. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
    python -m venv venv

5. Configure the application by editing the core/config.py file. Make sure to provide the correct values for PostgreSQL and Redis connections.

6. Create the necessary databases for the services. Database files are located in the database/ folder.

7. üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>
You can run the unit tests to verify that everything is working correctly. The tests ensure that the application functions as expected.
Example of running tests:
    ```bash
      python -m pytest tests/
